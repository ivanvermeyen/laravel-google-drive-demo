# Laravel & Google Drive Storage

[![ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/R6R3UQ8V)

#### Demo project with Laravel 5.4

Look at the commit history to see each of the steps I have taken to set this up.

## Set up this demo project locally

```
git clone git@github.com:ivanvermeyen/laravel-google-drive-demo.git
composer install
```

### I took care of this:

This will also install only [one additional package](https://github.com/nao-pon/flysystem-google-drive) that is not included by Laravel out of the box:

```
"nao-pon/flysystem-google-drive": "~1.1"
```

I have included [GoogleDriveAdapter](app/Providers/GoogleDriveAdapter.php) and [GoogleDriveServiceProvider](app/Providers/GoogleDriveServiceProvider.php) which I have added to the `providers` array in [`config/app.php`](config/app.php), and added a `google` disk in [`config/filesystems.php`](config/filesystems.php):

```php
'disks' => [

    // ...

    'google' => [
        'driver' => 'google',
        'clientId' => env('GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID'),
        'clientSecret' => env('GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET'),
        'refreshToken' => env('GOOGLE_DRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN'),
        'folderId' => env('GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID'),
        // 'teamDriveId' => env('GOOGLE_DRIVE_TEAM_DRIVE_ID'),
    ],

    // ...

],
```

## Create your Google Drive API keys

Detailed information on how to obtain your API ID, secret and refresh token:

-   [Getting your Client ID and Secret](README/1-getting-your-dlient-id-and-secret.md)
-   [Getting your Refresh Token](README/2-getting-your-refresh-token.md)
-   [Getting your Root Folder ID](README/3-getting-your-root-folder-id.md)

## Update `.env` file

Add the keys you created to your `.env` file and set `google` as your default cloud storage. You can copy the [`.env.example`](.env.example) file and fill in the blanks.

```
FILESYSTEM_CLOUD=google
GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID=xxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET=xxx
GOOGLE_DRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN=xxx
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=null
#GOOGLE_DRIVE_TEAM_DRIVE_ID=xxx
```

## Using multiple Google Drive accounts

If you want to use multiple Google Drive accounts in a single Laravel app, you need to get the API keys for each one as described above and store them separately in your `.env` file:

```
MAIN_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID=xxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
MAIN_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET=xxx
MAIN_GOOGLE_DRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN=xxx
MAIN_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=null

BACKUP_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID=xxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
BACKUP_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET=xxx
BACKUP_GOOGLE_DRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN=xxx
BACKUP_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=null
```

Then you should add a disk in `config/filesystems.php` for each account using the `google` driver and the account specific keys:

```php
'main_google' => [
    'driver' => 'google',
    'clientId' => env('MAIN_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID'),
    'clientSecret' => env('MAIN_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET'),
    'refreshToken' => env('MAIN_GOOGLE_DRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN'),
    'folderId' => env('MAIN_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID'),
],

'backup_google' => [
    'driver' => 'google',
    'clientId' => env('BACKUP_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID'),
    'clientSecret' => env('BACKUP_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET'),
    'refreshToken' => env('BACKUP_GOOGLE_DRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN'),
    'folderId' => env('BACKUP_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID'),
],
```

Now you can access the drives like so:

```php
$mainDisk = Storage::disk('main_google');
$backupDisk = Storage::disk('backup_google');
```

Keep in mind that there can only be one default cloud storage drive, defined by `FILESYSTEM_CLOUD` in your `.env` (or config) file. If you set it to `main_google`, that will be the cloud drive:

```php
Storage::cloud(); // refers to Storage::disk('main_google')
```
